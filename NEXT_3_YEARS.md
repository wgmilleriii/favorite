> **Apollo says:** THREE YEARS?! That's like DECADES in dog years! By then I'll be a DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN with possibly some distinguished grey hairs! I wonder if the humans will still play fetch with me (OF COURSE THEY WILL, I'm IRRESISTIBLE)! Maybe by then they'll finally understand that squirrels are a SERIOUS THREAT that requires CONSTANT VIGILANCE!
