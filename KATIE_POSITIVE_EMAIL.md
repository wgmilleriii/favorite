Subject: Let's Make This Printify Thing Super Easy! ðŸ˜Š


Hi Katie,

First off, thanks so much for taking this on! I know Printify can seem complicated at first, but I promise it gets much easier with practice. Let's simplify things:

## The Super-Easy Way Forward

I've created a much simpler set of instructions that we can tackle together. Instead of trying to do everything at once, let's break it down into tiny steps with check-ins:

1. **Just focus on creating your account first**
   - Go to: https://printify.com/app/login
   - Click "Sign Up" and use your email
   - Text me when that's done (no rush at all!)

2. **After your account is created, I'll help with the next step**
   - We'll tackle one small piece at a time
   - No need to remember everything at once
   - I'm here to guide you through each part

## What's Working Well

The good news is that you've already understood what we're trying to accomplish - creating a t-shirt in Printify. That's the hardest part! The technical steps are just details we can figure out together.

## Options That Might Work Better

Would any of these alternatives be more helpful?
- A quick 15-minute phone call where I walk you through it
- A screen-sharing session where I can show you exactly what to click
- A simple video recording of me going through the steps
- Meeting in person to do it together

There's no wrong answer here - whatever makes you most comfortable!

## Remember

- This is new for everyone at first
- There's no rush or pressure
- We can try multiple approaches
- I'm happy to help however works best for you

Let me know what you think would work best, and we'll make this happen!

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Chip
