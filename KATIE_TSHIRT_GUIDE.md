# T-Shirt Creation Guide for Katie

Hi Katie,

This guide will walk you through creating a t-shirt on our Printify store. I've broken it down into simple steps with screenshots to make it as easy as possible.

## Step 1: Access Our Products Page

1. Log in to Printify using your account credentials at https://printify.com/app/login
2. Once logged in, go directly to our products page using this link:
   **[https://printify.com/app/store/products/1?itemsPerPage=24](https://printify.com/app/store/products/1?itemsPerPage=24)**
3. If the link doesn't work directly, navigate to "Products" in the left sidebar

## Step 2: Start Your T-Shirt Design

1. Click the **"Add product"** button (usually in the top-right corner)
2. In the product catalog, select **"T-shirts & Tanks"** category
3. Browse the available t-shirt options - I recommend starting with the **Gildan 64000** or **Bella+Canvas 3001** as they're reliable options
4. Click on your preferred t-shirt to continue

## Step 3: Customize Your Design

1. You'll enter the design editor where you can upload and position your artwork
2. Click **"Add graphics"** to upload your design file
   - Recommended formats: PNG or JPG with transparent background
   - Optimal resolution: At least 300 DPI
   - Size your design appropriately (typically 10-12" width for front designs)
3. Position your design on the t-shirt preview
   - Use the alignment tools to center or position as needed
   - Check both front and back views if applicable
4. Preview different t-shirt colors using the color selector
5. Make sure to check the mockup view to see how it will look

## Step 4: Set Product Details

1. Scroll down to fill out product information:
   - **Title**: Create a descriptive, keyword-rich name
   - **Description**: Write details about the design, material, fit, and care instructions
   - **Price**: Set your retail price (our recommended price range is $20-30)
2. Select which sizes and colors you want to offer
   - Start with standard sizes (S-XL) and popular colors unless you have specific preferences
   - Note that each color/size combination will appear as a variant

## Step 5: Publish Your T-Shirt

1. Review all details one final time
2. Click **"Preview"** to see exactly how it will appear in the store
3. If everything looks good, click **"Publish"**
4. Choose where to publish:
   - Select our Etsy store from the dropdown
   - You can also save as draft if you want me to review before publishing

## Important Tips

- Always check the print area guidelines (indicated by the blue box in the designer)
- Keep critical design elements away from seams and edges
- Darker shirts require designs with transparent backgrounds
- Allow 30-60 minutes for your first design; it gets much faster with practice
- Save your work frequently using the "Save" button

## If You Get Stuck

- Call or text me at 505-600-1077 for immediate help
- Check Printify's help articles (click the "?" icon on any page)
- Look for the "Preview" button frequently to check your progress

I'm happy to schedule a quick screen sharing session if you'd prefer a live walkthrough for your first design. Just let me know what time works for you!

Good luck,
Chip
