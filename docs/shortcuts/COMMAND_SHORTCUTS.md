```bash
GOODMORNING

> Found 3 new updates

SNOOP
> Inspecting neighbor's repo...
> Differences found in .cursorrules
> Generated comparison report

BYEBYE

### Common Patterns:
1. Start day: `GOODMORNING`
2. Check progress: `SNOOP`
3. Regular check-ins: `CHECKIN`
4. End day: `BYEBYE`

## Tips
- Use `CHECKIN` every 15 minutes to stay focused
- `SNOOP` before making major changes
- End questions with `?` or `??` for different detail levels
- Use `!` when something goes wrong

## Neighbor Integration
- Neighbor's repo is one level up
- Similar .cursorrules expected
- Use `DUMPTONEIGHBOR` carefully
