🐾 APOLLO'S GUIDE TO HUMAN COMMUNICATION 🐾

*Woof! As the family's Chief Communication Officer (and expert at reading human emotions), I've noticed some important patterns!*

## Katie's Conversation Starters
### The "Sorry" Pattern
🚫 What it sounds like to Chip:
- An admission of wrongdoing
- Something that needs forgiveness
- A reason for concern

✨ What Katie actually means:
- "Hey, I'd like to start a conversation!"
- "I have something on my mind!"
- "Let's connect about something!"

💡 Better Alternatives (Tail-wagging approved!):
1. "Hey Chip, can we chat?"
2. "I've been thinking about something..."
3. "I'd love your perspective on..."
4. "Got a minute to connect?"

Remember: Just like I don't actually see squirrels EVERY time I bark (sometimes I just want attention!), Katie doesn't actually feel sorry when she says "sorry" - it's just her way of opening the door to connection! 

## Apollo's Communication Tips
- Wag first, bark later (Start positive!)
- Direct eye contact means love (or treats!)
- Sometimes humans need help translating each other (That's why I'm here!)

*Note: This document will be updated as I observe more human communication patterns. Right now I need to go practice my welcome dance for when Chip comes home at 6:00 PM!* 🐾
