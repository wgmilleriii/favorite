## Calendar Sharing Methodology

ICS (iCalendar) file sharing provides an efficient method for calendar synchronization:

1. Calendar data is encoded in a standardized format with .ics extension
2. Calendars can be imported into various calendar applications
3. Shared calendars provide view-only access to all events
4. Updates to the source calendar propagate to all subscribers

## Google Calendar ICS URL Acquisition

To obtain a Google Calendar ICS URL for sharing:

1. Navigate to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) 
2. Locate the calendar name in the left sidebar and select the three dots menu
3. Select "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll to the "Integrate calendar" section 
5. Locate "Secret address in iCal format" 
6. Copy the URL

## Security Considerations

When sharing calendar URLs, observe the following security protocols:

- Share URLs only with trusted individuals
- Calendar URLs provide view access to all calendar events
- Consider calendar visibility settings for sensitive information
- Create separate calendars for confidential appointments if necessary

## Family Schedule Coordination Benefits

Shared calendar access facilitates:
- Coordinated care for Jim's medical appointments
- Efficient meal planning around work schedules
- Prevention of scheduling conflicts
- Consistent care for Apollo
