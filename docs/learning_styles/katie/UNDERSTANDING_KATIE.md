# Understanding Katie: A Communication Guide

## Background
Katie has a degree in Visual Arts, bringing a creative perspective and visual thinking to her approach to tasks. She relocated to Albuquerque specifically to care for her parents, demonstrating her commitment to family and willingness to make significant life changes for those she loves.

## Temperament & Learning Style
- **Visual Thinker**: With her arts background, Katie processes information best through visual means (images, diagrams, examples)
- **Thoughtful Processor**: Needs time to absorb new information (indicated by the 45-minute response time noted in documents)
- **Detail-Oriented**: Likely notices visual inconsistencies and appreciates aesthetic quality
- **Caregiving Mindset**: Accustomed to helping others, may sometimes put her needs second

## Communication Preferences
- **Clear, Direct Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance works best
- **Visual Demonstrations**: Screenshots, videos, or visual examples are extremely helpful
- **Confirmation Checkpoints**: Benefits from checking understanding at each step
- **Patient Approach**: Responds better to calm, unhurried communication
- **Phone Calls**: Sometimes more effective than text-based instructions for complex topics

## Strengths
- **Visual Creativity**: Can likely envision and critique designs effectively
- **Attention to Detail**: Valuable for design work and quality control
- **Commitment**: Demonstrates strong follow-through on important commitments
- **Empathy**: Understanding of others' needs from caregiving experience

## Technology Context
- **Learning Curve**: May take longer with new technical platforms (like Printify)
- **Preference for Purpose**: Likely engages better when understanding the "why" behind tasks
- **Frustration Threshold**: May need encouragement when facing technical challenges
- **Transfer of Skills**: Visual arts skills can transfer well to design platforms once comfortable

## Effective Approaches
- Break complex technical tasks into smaller, visual steps
- Provide clear success criteria for each step
- Offer multiple communication channels (text, call, email)
- Validate progress and efforts
- Connect technical tasks to her creative strengths whenever possible
- Allow for processing time after introducing new concepts
- Follow up with gentle check-ins rather than pushing for immediate responses

## Project Relevance
Katie's visual arts background makes her uniquely qualified for the Printify t-shirt design work, once she becomes comfortable with the platform. Her aesthetic sense and design understanding will be valuable assets to the project.
