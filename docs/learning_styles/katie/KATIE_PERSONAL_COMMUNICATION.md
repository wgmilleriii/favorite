### Communication Style Matching

| When talking to... | Try this approach... | Visual cue to remember |
|---|---|---|
| Chip | Pause more, ask questions, less intensity | 🎹 (Piano keys need space between notes) |
| Jim | Clear, concrete language, visual aids | 🦽 (Focus on accessibility) |
| Work colleagues | Professional enthusiasm, organized visuals | 👔 (Structured but still you) |
| Friends | Full expression, mutual energy | 🌈 (All colors welcome) |

## 🎨 Techniques That Play to Your Visual Strengths

1. **Sketch your thoughts** — Before important conversations, create a quick visual map
2. **Color-code your communication** — Use consistent colors for different types of messages:
   * 🔴 Urgent/Important
   * 🟠 Needs response today
   * 🟢 Information sharing
   * 🔵 Personal/Emotional
   * 🟣 Creative ideas

3. **Create visual anchors** — Use physical gestures or objects to represent complex ideas
4. **Take "picture notes"** — Use your phone to capture visual information rather than writing
5. **Use visual metaphors** — "It's like a puzzle where we're missing the edge pieces"
