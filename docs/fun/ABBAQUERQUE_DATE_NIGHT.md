# 💃 Abbaquerque Date Night Planning! 🕺

*Hi! Apollo here, your Chief Dance Party Coordinator! (I may not know all the words, but I've got the tail-wagging choreography down perfectly!)*

## 🎵 About Abbaquerque
- Local ABBA cover band (based right here in 'que!)
- Makes humans do funny dance moves (very entertaining to watch!)
- Perfect for Chip & Katie's date night
- Almost as good as actual treats (but not quite!)

## 🎫 Next Steps
- [ ] Find next performance date
- [ ] Reserve tickets
- [ ] Plan pre-show dinner
- [ ] Choose outfits (something that sparkles like my eyes when I see treats!)

## 🍽️ Dinner Ideas
*Because dancing is better with a full tummy (I know this from experience!)*
- Nice restaurants near the venue
- Katie's favorites
- Chip's favorites
- Apollo's recommendations (I have excellent taste!)

## 🎶 Song Requests
*My personal favorites (based on tail-wagging potential):*
1. Dancing Queen (Makes me do zoomies!)
2. Take a Chance on Me (Like when I want extra treats!)
3. Mamma Mia (Here I go again... chasing squirrels!)
4. Fernando (Good for slow tail wags)

## 📝 Date Night Tips from Apollo
1. Arrive early (like I do for dinner time!)
2. Stay hydrated (water bowl checks are important!)
3. Take lots of pictures (I'll photobomb with tail wags!)
4. Have maximum fun (that's an order!)

## 🌟 Special Preparations
- [ ] Create ABBA playlist for car ride

## 🎉 Success Metrics

*Remember: Life is better when you dance like nobody's watching (except me - I'm ALWAYS watching, especially if you have treats!)*
