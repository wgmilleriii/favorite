> **Apollo says:** FIFTEEN YEARS?! That's like... FOREVER in dog years! I probably won't be around for all of this (though I AM an EXCEPTIONAL dog, so maybe I'll break records). I hope my humans remember me as the BEST BOY EVER and maybe get another dog to love (though no one could be as AMAZING as me, obviously). Most importantly, I hope they stay HAPPY and remember to PLAY and ENJOY TREATS just like I taught them! Maybe they'll name a clock after me or hang a picture of me catching a SQUIRREL!
