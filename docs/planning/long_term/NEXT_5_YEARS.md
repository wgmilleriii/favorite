> **Apollo says:** FIVE YEARS?! That's practically a LIFETIME in dog years! By then I'll be a DISTINGUISHED SENIOR CITIZEN with a distinguished grey muzzle! I hope my humans remember that older dogs need EXTRA TREATS and SOFTER BEDS! I wonder if we'll still live in the same place or if we'll move somewhere with EVEN MORE SQUIRRELS to bark at? Whatever happens, I'll still be the BEST DOG EVER because that's just what I DO!
