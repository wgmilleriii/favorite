> **Apollo says:** SIX MONTHS sounds like DOG YEARS to me! By then I'll be even MORE perfect than I am now (if that's even possible)! I'm looking forward to SUMMER because that means more OUTSIDE TIME which means more SQUIRRELS! Also, Katie's birthday means CAKE, and sometimes CAKE falls on the FLOOR! Strategic positioning will be required!
