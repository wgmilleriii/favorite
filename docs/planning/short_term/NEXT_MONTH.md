> **Apollo says:** A WHOLE MONTH of human activities! That's practically FOREVER in dog time! By the end of this month, I'll have had approximately 723 naps, eaten about 1,200 meals, and barked at countless squirrels! The humans seem very busy with all these "responsibilities" when they COULD just be playing with ME instead!
