> **Apollo says:** A WHOLE WEEK of activities! SO EXCITING! I'll make sure to supervise ALL of it! I'm especially interested in the Chinese food dinner (for OBVIOUS reasons) and the Sunday family time (because FAMILY = BEST)! I hope I get to go to Jim's property too - new places have NEW SMELLS and possibly NEW SQUIRRELS!
