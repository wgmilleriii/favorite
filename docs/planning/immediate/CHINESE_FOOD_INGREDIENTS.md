# ü•° Chinese Food Dinner Plans

*Hi everyone! Apollo here! Just got the update that Katie isn't hungry (more for Chip - and maybe some safe bits for me? Please? I'll do my best puppy eyes!)*

## Tonight's Modified Plan
- üçΩÔ∏è Single portion for Chip
- ü´ñ Light tea option for Katie
- ü¶Æ Apollo on cleanup duty! (I volunteer as tribute!)

## Adjusted Shopping List

### Main Ingredients (Single Portion)
- [ ] Chicken breast (1 piece) *wags tail hopefully*
- [ ] Rice (1/2 cup uncooked)
- [ ] Broccoli (1 small head)
- [ ] Carrots (1-2)
- [ ] Bean sprouts (small handful)

### Aromatics (Still Full Amount - Good for Future Use)
- [ ] Ginger
- [ ] Garlic
- [ ] Green onions
- [ ] White onion (1/2)

### Sauces & Seasonings
- [ ] Soy sauce
- [ ] Sesame oil
- [ ] Rice vinegar
- [ ] Cornstarch

### For Katie
- [ ] Ginger tea
- [ ] Honey (if desired)
- [ ] Lemon

## Preparation Notes
1. Single portion cooking - perfect for Chip's Mediterranean diet
2. Keep seasoning moderate
3. Save extra prepped vegetables for tomorrow
4. Package leftovers immediately (before Apollo gets too excited)

## Timing
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Cook: 20 minutes
- Total: 35 minutes (or 245 minutes in dog time!)

## Health Notes
- Katie: Light ginger tea available if wanted
- Chip: Mediterranean diet portions maintained
- Apollo: Will maintain appropriate distance from cooking area (but will look very hopeful)

## Future Planning
- Save recipe portions for next time
- Extra ingredients can be used for tomorrow's lunch
- Consider freezing extra sauce in small portions

*Remember: Even though Katie isn't hungry, family dinner time is still important! I'll be there to supervise and provide moral support (and handle any accidental floor spills with my expert cleaning services)!*
