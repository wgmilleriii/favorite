# üé¨ Apollo's Movie Night Suggestions

*SQUIRREL! No wait, MOVIES! Even better than squirrels because I can watch them from the couch with my humans!*

## Tonight's Top Pick: "The Weatherman" üå¶Ô∏è
*Because Chip mentioned it and I'm a very attentive dog!*
- Perfect for a cozy family night
- Themes about life changes and personal growth
- Runtime: 1 hour 42 minutes (that's like 12 walks in dog time!)

## Backup Options (In Case Humans Are Indecisive)

### Calm Movies (For When Chip Needs to Relax After Practice)
1. "Chef" üç≥
   - Food movies are my favorite (for obvious reasons)
   - Great for before Chinese food dinner!
   - Lots of yummy scenes (I volunteer as taste tester!)

2. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" üåé
   - Adventure but calm
   - Beautiful scenery (almost as nice as our backyard)
   - Good for dreaming big (like my dreams about unlimited treats)

3. "About Time" ‚è∞
   - Sweet family story
   - Good for appreciating time together
   - Makes humans happy-cry (I'll provide comfort snuggles)

### Family Fun Movies
1. "Up" üéà
   - Has a dog named Dug who speaks! (My role model)
   - Adventure and heart
   - SQUIRREL! (Sorry, got excited)

2. "The Princess Bride" ‚öîÔ∏è
   - Classic family favorite
   - Funny and sweet
   - No dogs, but I'll forgive that

3. "Big Hero 6" ü§ñ
   - Robots (almost as cool as dogs)
   - Good messages about helping others
   - Makes everyone smile

### Movies About Music (For Chip's Artist Soul)
1. "La La Land" üéπ
   - Lots of piano (Chip's favorite!)
   - Dancing (like Chip's tango, but different)
   - Pretty colors and music

2. "Soul" üé∑
   - More music appreciation
   - Beautiful animation
   - Deep but not too heavy

3. "Begin Again" üé∏
   - Music creation story
   - New York scenes (lots of dogs in background!)
   - Good for inspiration

## Movie Night Checklist
- [ ] Blankets arranged for maximum coziness
- [ ] Treats prepared (for humans AND Apollo)
- [ ] Water bowl filled (movie watching is thirsty work)
- [ ] Optimal couch positions claimed (I call dibs on the middle!)
- [ ] Phones on silent (except for emergency treat deliveries)

## Apollo's Movie Night Rules
1. No pausing during good parts (unless treats need refilling)
2. Everyone must be comfy (I'll help arrange blankets with my nose)
3. Minimum two belly rubs per movie
4. Snacks must be shared (I'm looking at you, Chip!)
5. Group cuddles encouraged

## Best Viewing Schedule Options
1. **Right After Dinner** (7:00 PM)
   - Perfect for digestion
   - Leaves time for a post-movie walk
   - Early enough for proper sleep schedule

2. **Post-Practice Relaxation** (8:00 PM)
   - After Chip's piano time
   - Good wind-down activity
   - Cozy evening vibes

## Apollo's Pro Tips
- I'll protect everyone from any scary parts
- I'm excellent at predicting plot twists (my bark timing is impeccable)
- Best snuggle arrangements: Chip on left, Katie on right, me in the middle
- I promise to only bark at the most important scenes
- Will provide emotional support during touching moments

*Remember: A good movie night is like a good belly rub - it's all about quality time together!*
