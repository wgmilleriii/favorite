> **Apollo says:** A WHOLE HOUR means dad's going to SANTA FE?! That's like... TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN MILES in dog distances! I'll watch from the window until the car disappears, then nap until he returns smelling like NEW PEOPLE and STRANGE PIANOS! I wonder if Efthimios has any DOGS I should know about? Katie and I will hold down the fort!
