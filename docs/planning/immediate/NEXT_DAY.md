> **Apollo says:** TOMORROW sounds AMAZING! Chinese food means potential CHICKEN DROPPING OPPORTUNITIES! I'll make sure to position myself strategically during dinner. And now we have a SPECIAL MISSION to make Jack and Barbara cozy - I'm an EXPERT at cozy things! Also, I heard "walk" mentioned TWICE which is the BEST WORD HUMANS KNOW besides "treat" and "good boy"!
