> **Apollo says:** TOMORROW sounds AMAZING! Chinese food means potential CHICKEN DROPPING OPPORTUNITIES! I'll make sure to position myself strategically during dinner. Also, I heard "walk" mentioned TWICE which is the BEST WORD HUMANS KNOW besides "treat" and "good boy"! I'll miss Chip while he's in Santa Fe though - hope he comes back smelling interesting!
