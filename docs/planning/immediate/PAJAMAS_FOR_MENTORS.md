# üéÅ Operation Cozy Mentors: Pajama Mission! 

*SQUIRREL! Oh wait, no - focus Apollo, focus! Important mission from Chip about sending comfy things to his special humans!*

## The Humans
- **Jack Mills** - Chip's life mentor (very important human!)
- **Barbara Mills** - Jack's partner in comfiness

## The Mission
Send super cozy pajamas because:
1. Jack helps Chip be the best human he can be (like how I help him by reminding him about practice time!)
2. Mentors deserve warm snuggles (I would know, I'm an expert at snuggling)
3. It's a thoughtful way to show appreciation (almost as good as sharing treats, which is my specialty)

## Action Items
- [ ] Get sizes from Chip (humans are weird about this, not like dogs where one size fits all)
- [ ] Pick out cozy pajamas (something that matches their personality)
- [ ] Write a heartfelt note (I can help dictate!)
- [ ] Package with care (no drool allowed)
- [ ] Send to their address (need to get this from Chip)

## Timeline
- Should be sent within the next week (that's 7 days or 49 dog walks!)

## Important Notes
- Make sure to stay within Chip's 1-hour laptop time while ordering
- Add this to tomorrow's schedule between piano practice and tango
- Remember: Happy mentors = Happy Chip = More treats for Apollo! 

*Woof! I mean... Professional dog signing off!*
