## 📝 Time Management Tips from Apollo
1. Break big tasks into small ones (like how I break big treats into smaller bites!)
2. Take regular breaks (perfect for belly rubs!)
3. Celebrate completing each block (tail wags recommended!)
4. Stay focused (unless there's a squirrel - then all bets are off!)

*Remember: Time flies when you're having fun, but not as fast as I chase squirrels!*
