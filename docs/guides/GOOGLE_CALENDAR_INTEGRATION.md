# üóìÔ∏è CALENDAR INTEGRATION GUIDE

*Hi Chip, it's Katie here! I thought I'd help put together a clear guide for sharing calendars since you've found your piano appointment calendar. As a visual person, I find step-by-step guides really helpful, so I've organized this in a way that makes sense to me.*

## üì± Your Gazelle Piano Calendar

I see you found your piano tuning calendar link from the Gazelle app:
```
https://gazelleapp.io/calendars/cal_BM7FwKln8bo6rZpqgShFT7CD0pPchDfS3mZ25UvCDxcx.ics
```

Looking at this calendar, I noticed:
- You have an appointment with Kari Stevenson and her Baldwin Grand Piano on January 18th
- There's a Steinway Grand tuning for Luke Gullickson on January 24th
- Randy Kohen has booked you for a piano restoration on February 8th (that Hardman Grand Baby sounds like a big job!)
- You're planning a Denver trip from January 30th to February 7th
- And you have regular appointments with Lucas

This is exactly the kind of information Favorite would need to know to plan around your work schedule!

## üîÑ Sharing Calendars Using ICS URLs

When I was taking art classes, our instructor shared the class calendar with us using a similar method. Here's how it works:

1. Each calendar has a special web address (URL) that ends with .ics
2. You can add these calendars to your Google Calendar to see all the events
3. Everyone with access can see the same information, which helps with planning
4. It's view-only, so nobody can accidentally change your appointments

## üîç How to Get Your Own Google Calendar ICS URL

If you want to share your personal Google Calendar with Favorite or me:

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) 
2. Find your calendar name in the left sidebar and click the three dots
3. Select "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll down until you see "Integrate calendar" 
5. Look for "Secret address in iCal format" - that's your ICS URL
6. Click the copy button to get the URL

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Considerations

As someone who values privacy (especially with Dad's healthcare information), I should mention:
- Only share calendar URLs with people you trust
- Anyone with the URL can see all events on that calendar
- They can't change anything, but they can view all details
- If you have sensitive information, create a separate calendar for those events

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family Calendar Benefits

Having shared access to each other's calendars would help us:
- Coordinate care for Dad more efficiently
- Plan family meals around your tuning schedule
- Avoid scheduling conflicts with my job interviews
- Make sure someone is always available for Apollo's walks

## üì≤ Adding Your Gazelle Calendar to Google

Here's how to add your piano tuning calendar to Google Calendar:

1. Open Google Calendar in your browser
2. Look for "Other calendars" on the left side
3. Click the + (plus) symbol next to it
4. Select "From URL" from the dropdown
5. Paste your Gazelle calendar URL: `https://gazelleapp.io/calendars/cal_BM7FwKln8bo6rZpqgShFT7CD0pPchDfS3mZ25UvCDxcx.ics`
6. Click "Add Calendar"
7. It should appear in your calendar list, probably labeled "Gazelle"
8. You can change the display color by clicking on it in the list

## üì§ Sharing With Favorite

Once you've added the calendar, here's how to share it with Favorite:

1. In Google Calendar, find the Gazelle calendar in your list
2. Click the three dots next to it
3. Select "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll to "Share with specific people" and click "Add people"
5. Enter Favorite's email address
6. Set permissions to "See all event details"
7. Click "Send"

She'll get an email with a link to add the calendar to her own Google Calendar.

## üì± Viewing on Mobile

Don't forget you can view all these shared calendars on your phone too:
1. Make sure you have the Google Calendar app installed
2. Sign in with the same account you used on the computer
3. All shared calendars should sync automatically

Hope this helps keep everyone on the same page with your piano tuning schedule!

P.S. We should do this with my schedule too once I hear back about the Williams Sonoma interview!
