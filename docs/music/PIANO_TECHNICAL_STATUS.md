# üéπ GRAND PIANO ACTION STUDY

*Woof! Time to understand these fascinating moving parts! - Apollo*

## üìä ACTION COMPONENTS STUDY
### Key Action Parts
1. Keys
   - Balance rail position
   - Front rail pin alignment
   - Key leading measurements
   - Front/back weight distribution

2. Wippen Assembly
   - Repetition lever
   - Jack position
   - Backcheck alignment
   - Heel position

3. Hammer Assembly
   - Shank angle
   - Head alignment
   - Knuckle position
   - Let-off distance

## ‚öñÔ∏è WEIGHT RATIO MEASUREMENTS
### Current Readings
```
   UPWEIGHT    DOWNWEIGHT    RATIO
   ---------   ----------    -----
   Bass:   50g    80g        1:1.6
   Tenor:  48g    75g        1:1.56
   Mid:    45g    72g        1:1.6
   Treble: 42g    70g        1:1.67
```

### Target Specifications
- Upweight: 45-50g (bass) to 42-45g (treble)
- Downweight: 70-80g (bass) to 65-72g (treble)
- Ideal ratio range: 1:1.5 to 1:1.7

## üîç MEASUREMENT PROTOCOLS
1. Static Measurements
   ‚ñ° Let-off distance: 1.8mm
   ‚ñ° After-touch: 1mm
   ‚ñ° Key dip: 10mm
   ‚ñ° Back rail spacing: 13mm

2. Dynamic Tests
   ‚ñ° Repetition speed
   ‚ñ° After-touch response
   ‚ñ° Let-off consistency
   ‚ñ° Back check timing

## üìà REGULATION PROGRESS
### Current Focus
- Fine-tuning jack position
- Optimizing let-off timing
- Balancing key weights
- Adjusting repetition spring tension

### Recent Adjustments
- Hammer rest position refined
- Back check timing improved
- Key leading optimized
- Damper timing synchronized

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS & EQUIPMENT
### Weight Measurement
- Lead weights set (1g increments)
- Digital balance scale
- Weight placement guide
- Calibration weights

### Distance Measurement
- Regulation ruler
- Feeler gauges
- Let-off blocks
- String height gauge

## üìù TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS
1. Action Response
   - Repetition speed: Excellent
   - Touch sensitivity: Optimal
   - Dynamic range: Full spectrum
   - Even response: Consistent

2. Weight Distribution
   - Front weight: Balanced
   - Back weight: Optimized
   - Total weight: Within specs
   - Weight progression: Smooth

## üéØ NEXT TECHNICAL STEPS
1. Complete bass section measurements
2. Document treble regulation specs
3. Create weight ratio charts
4. Update technical diagrams

*Note: Apollo suggests more treats improve measurement accuracy! üêæ*
