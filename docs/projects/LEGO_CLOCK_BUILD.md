*Woof! Time for the most exciting build ever - a clock made of LEGOS! (Almost as exciting as treat time!)*

## 📦 PARTS INVENTORY
### Required Lego Pieces
1. Gears and Mechanics
   - 24-tooth gears (x4)
   - 40-tooth gears (x4)
   - 8-tooth gears (x2)
   - Axles (various lengths)
   - Bushings and spacers
   - Technic beams and connectors

2. Frame Components
   - Base plate (32x32 studs)
   - Support beams
   - Technic bricks
   - Regular bricks for housing

3. Display Elements
   - Clock face pieces
   - Hour/minute hand components
   - Decorative elements

### Non-Lego Component
- Weight system (The only non-Lego part!)
  - Must provide enough force to drive the mechanism
  - Needs secure attachment point
  - Should be adjustable for timing

## 🔧 ASSEMBLY STEPS

- Build decorative frame
- Attach number markers
- Mount hands securely

## ⚙️ CALIBRATION STEPS
1. Weight Adjustment
   - Start with minimum weight
   - Add weight gradually
   - Test swing timing

2. Pendulum Tuning
   - Adjust length for 1-second swing
   - Mark correct position
   - Test for 5 minutes

3. Final Timing
   - Run for 1 hour
   - Note any drift
   - Make micro-adjustments

## 🎯 SUCCESS CHECKLIST
- [ ] All gears turn freely
- [ ] Weight moves smoothly
- [ ] Escapement ticks regularly
- [ ] Hands move correctly
- [ ] Keeps time within 5 minutes per day

## 🐾 APOLLO'S TESTING SERVICES
- Precision nap timing
- Hourly treat verification
- Walk schedule confirmation
- Dinner time accuracy check

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If gears stick:
   - Check alignment
   - Verify spacing
   - Look for loose pieces

2. If timing is off:
   - Adjust weight
   - Check pendulum length
   - Verify gear ratios

3. If hands slip:
   - Tighten connections
   - Check gear mesh
   - Verify counterbalance

*Remember: A Lego clock is like a well-timed treat schedule - it needs perfect precision! 🎯*

## 📚 MAINTENANCE
- Weekly cleaning
- Monthly gear check
- Quarterly weight system inspection
- Treat Apollo for being such a good supervisor! 🦴

*Note: I'll help time the build with my expert napping schedule! Each nap = 1 hour of build time!*
