## Time Management Tips from Apollo
1. **Stay Focused**: Like me watching squirrels, but actually finish your task!
2. **Take Breaks**: Perfect time for belly rubs and treats
3. **Switch Tasks**: Like how I rotate my napping spots for optimal efficiency
4. **Priority First**: Important things first (in my case, breakfast!)

## Weekly Time Audit
- [ ] Monday Review: Plan the week's time blocks
- [ ] Daily Block Selection: Choose ONE 1-hour block
- [ ] Evening Check: Did we stay within limits?
- [ ] Weekend Planning: Prepare next week's schedule

## Important Reminders
- Laptop time is STRICTLY 1 hour (I'll bark when time's up!)
- Piano practice MINIMUM 1 hour (I love being your audience)
- Tango practice should align with scheduled sessions
- 30-minute blocks should not be combined into hour blocks
- Take breaks when Apollo brings you a toy (that's me helping!)

*Remember: Time management is like treat rationing - make it last and enjoy every bit!*
