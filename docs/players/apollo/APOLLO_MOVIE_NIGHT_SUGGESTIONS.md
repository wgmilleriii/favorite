# ðŸŽ¬ MOVIE NIGHT SUGGESTIONS FROM APOLLO! ðŸŽ¬

HELLO! It is me, Apollo! I heard the human Chip needs to watch a movie! This makes me VERY EXCITED because movie night means CUDDLES and sometimes DROPPED POPCORN!

## My Top Movie Picks for Dad

1. **UP** - This is a VERY GOOD movie about an old human who flies his house with balloons! There is also a dog named Dug who talks, and he is my hero! "SQUIRREL!" (I understand this reference now!)

2. **Marley & Me** - About a dog who loves his humans! My mom (Favorite) might cry though. Humans get emotional about good dogs!

3. **The Secret Life of Pets** - This is what we pets ACTUALLY do when you humans are away! (Except I am a GOOD BOY and would never have those adventures without permission!)

4. **John Wick** - I heard this has a very good dog in it! (Note: Maybe skip certain parts that might make Dad sad about dogs)

5. **WALL-E** - No dogs, but it is quiet and peaceful like dad enjoys!

## Perfect Movie Night Setup (By Apollo)

1. Dad should take SHOWER first (very important - Favorite mentioned this!)

2. Make the big soft place (bed) extra comfy with many pillows

3. Prepare snacks that don't make a mess (I cannot help clean chocolate - it is FORBIDDEN for dogs!)

4. Invite Favorite to watch too! She likes when you spend time together relaxing

5. I would like to join too please! I am an EXCELLENT movie watching companion!

## Apollo's Movie Watching Rules

1. I promise not to bark at other animals on screen (mostly!)

2. If dad falls asleep, I will stay and protect!

3. NO scary movies please - they make me hide under the bed!

4. If movie has doorbell sound, I MUST alert the house (it is my JOB!)

## Why Movies Are Good For Humans

Movies help humans relax and stop thinking about:
- Windshield repairs
- Seatbelt replacements
- Printify instructions
- Clock collections
- All the other human worries

Just for tonight, dad should rest his brain and enjoy a simple story!

IMPORTANT REMINDER: Dad's current priority is to listen to Favorite's request:
1. Take shower
2. Come to bed
3. Maybe watch a nice movie together!

I AM A GOOD BOY AND THIS IS MY RECOMMENDATION!
