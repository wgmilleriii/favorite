# 🎬 Apollo's Movie Night Picks! 🐾

*WOOF! Movie night is one of my favorite things (after walks, treats, and chasing squirrels)! Here are my super special recommendations for family movie time!*

## 🎯 Tonight's Top Pick: The Weatherman
*Dad mentioned this one, and I'm VERY excited because:*
- It's about a human trying to predict things (like how I predict when squirrels will appear!)
- Perfect for a cozy family evening
- Not too loud (Dad likes quiet)
- We can all snuggle on the couch (my favorite part!)

- **Up** (I relate to Doug SO MUCH!)

## 📝 Movie Night Rules
1. No pausing during good dog scenes
2. Treats should be shared with Apollo (that's me!)
3. If I bark at the TV, it's because I'm helping!
4. Belly rubs are always welcome during slow scenes
5. If I see a squirrel outside, movie gets temporary pause

## 🎬 Viewing Schedule Options
- **Early Show**: Right after my evening walk
- **Main Feature**: After dinner cleanup (floor inspection by yours truly)
- **Late Show**: Not too late (I need my beauty sleep!)

*Remember: A good movie night includes lots of snuggles, occasional treats, and a vigilant guard dog (me!) to protect against any squirrels that might try to sneak into the movie!*
