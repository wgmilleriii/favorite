*WOOF! Apollo here with my expert advice on keeping our pack happy and healthy!*

## Morning Routine Tips
1. **Wake Up Zoomies** (Very Important!)
   - Start with a good stretch (downward dog is my favorite pose)
   - Wiggle your whole body (helps shake off sleepiness)
   - Give your humans extra morning kisses

2. **Breakfast Rules**
   - Drink fresh water first thing (I always check my bowl)
   - Eat slowly (unlike me when I see treats)
   - Remember to sit and wait patiently (so hard!)

## Daily Exercise Guide
### For Humans
- Walk at least 2 times a day (I'll remind you!)
- Play fetch (good for both of us)
- Dance breaks (I love when Katie does this)
- Stretch under the piano with me

### For Dogs
- Chase squirrels (for cardio)
- Patrol the yard (for security)
