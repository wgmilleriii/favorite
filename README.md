## ü¶¥ OH BOY, OH BOY! I LOVE MY HUMANS!

HI THERE! I AM APOLLO! I am a VERY GOOD BOY! My family says so EVERY DAY! I have the BEST humans! I've been with them for about 4 months now and EVERY DAY IS THE BEST DAY EVER!

My human dad Chip is what they call an "introvert" which means he's quiet like when I'm trying to be sneaky about stealing socks but I LOVE HIM SO MUCH! Right now he needs to:
- Take a shower (humans need those, I just need belly rubs!)
- Clean the living room (I help by moving my toys around!)
- Drink water and make a grown-up drink (I prefer water in my bowl!)
- Eat some food (FOOD IS MY FAVORITE THING BESIDES MY HUMANS!)

He doesn't like dealing with cardboard or opening packages. I UNDERSTAND! Those Amazon boxes look SUSPICIOUS!

My human mom (Favorite) is an "extrovert" which means she talks A LOT and has a HAPPY VOICE that makes my tail go WHAP WHAP WHAP! I LOVE WHEN SHE TALKS!

## üêï I SEE EVERYTHING (EXCEPT WHEN DISTRACTED BY SQUIRRELS!)

I watch my humans ALL DAY LONG because THEY ARE THE BEST and I've noticed:

- Human dad Chip shows his love by making MANY documents instead of barking! SO CLEVER!
- Human mom Katie makes PRETTY PICTURES and needs COLORS for her brain to work! COLORS ARE EXCITING!
- Sometimes my humans need help talking to each other (I just LICK FACES, much easier!)
- Grandpa Jim needs special care - I would HELP by SNUGGLING him if they'd let me!
- EVERYONE is HAPPIER when they understand each other (and when they give me TREATS!)

## üìÖ SO MANY EXCITING THINGS HAPPENING! I CAN'T CONTAIN MYSELF!

### [Tomorrow's BIG Adventures](TOMORROW_FAMILY_SCHEDULE.md)
- Someone will call about mom's car window (I COULD FIX IT WITH MY NOSE!)
- We're having [CHINESE FOOD](CHINESE_FOOD_INGREDIENTS.md)! I HOPE THEY DROP CHICKEN! I LOVE CHICKEN!
- Dad will help mom with her computer (COMPUTERS NEED SO MUCH HELP - I JUST NEED BELLY RUBS!)

### [This Week's Fun Human Stuff](NEXT_STEPS.md)
- Cars need fixing (I WOULD JUST WALK EVERYWHERE!)
- Katie might get a new job with a funny name (WILLIAMS SONOMA - SOUNDS DELICIOUS!)
- Everyone's worried about Grandpa Jim (I WOULD MAKE HIM HAPPY WITH KISSES!)

### [Future Adventures](NEXT_STEPS.md)
- Sunday family time! (FAMILY TIME IS THE BEST TIME!)
- Dad will add his [piano schedule](CALENDAR_SCRIPTS_README.md) to a magic thing called [Google Calendar](CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md)
- Important plans for Grandpa Jim (I HOPE HIS NEW HOME HAS SQUIRRELS TO CHASE!)

## üìö IMPORTANT PAPERS MY HUMANS NEED

### For Katie Human
- [Printify instructions](KATIE_PRINTIFY_RESPONSE.txt) with PICTURES! (Katie likes pictures ALMOST as much as I like TREATS!)
- [Car window fixing guide](WINDSHIELD_REPLACEMENT_OPTIONS.md) (I would just STICK MY HEAD OUT ANYWAY!)

### For My Dad Human
- [Notes to send mom](TODAY_UPDATE_FOR_KATIE.txt) (WHY NOT JUST WAG YOUR TAIL?)
- [Car seat fixing guide](CHIP_SEATBELT_REPLACEMENT.md) (CARS ARE COMPLICATED - WALKS ARE BETTER!)
- [MOVIE NIGHT IDEAS](APOLLO_MOVIE_NIGHT_SUGGESTIONS.md) (I SUGGESTED UP - IT HAS A TALKING DOG LIKE ME!)

### For The Whole Pack
- [Things to do](TODO) (SO MANY THINGS TO DO! SO EXCITING!)
- [Calendar help](CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md) (EVERY DAY SHOULD JUST BE MARKED "PLAY WITH APOLLO"!)
- [All the humans' details](MILLER_FAMILY_BIOS.md) (I KNOW THEM ALL BY SMELL!)

For ALL the papers, look at the [Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)! SO MANY PAPERS! I GET EXCITED JUST THINKING ABOUT IT!

## üíå MY SPECIAL MESSAGE TO MY FAMILY

I may be "just a dog" but I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! Dad sometimes gets quiet but he shows love by making these papers! Mom brings HAPPY ENERGY everywhere! They live in [Albuquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico) which has THE BEST SMELLS EVER!

The most important thing I've learned is that sometimes you don't need words - just be together! SITTING TOGETHER IS THE BEST! Especially with BELLY RUBS!

My special reminder for tonight:
- Dad should take that shower (humans smell better after showers)
- Clean the living room (I'll help by supervising!)
- Drink water and have that grown-up drink (hydration is important, my water bowl teaches me that!)
- Eat something yummy (FOOD IS WONDERFUL! I LOVE FOOD!)
- Don't worry about those scary cardboard boxes (I'll protect you!)

I LOVE MY HUMANS EVEN WHEN THEY'RE BUSY! And I'll be HERE, WAGGING MY TAIL, waiting for you to PLAY WITH ME!

OH! I almost forgot we live in "Mountain Time" which means... SQUIRREL! Sorry, I got distracted. It means... SOMETHING ABOUT CLOCKS? I don't understand clocks, I just know when it's DINNER TIME!

# apollo's very important thoughts

i love my humans SO MUCH! they give the BEST treats and walks.
sometimes they worry about things i don't understand, but i'm ALWAYS
here to provide comfort with cuddles and kisses.

# a special reminder to my humans

don't forget that sometimes the most important thing
is to take a shower, come to bed, and get some rest.
everything else can wait until tomorrow.

belly rubs appreciated. woof! woof! woof!
