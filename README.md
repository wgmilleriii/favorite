# SQUIRREL! I mean... Welcome to Our Family's Special Place! üêæ

*WOOF! Apollo here! I'm so excited you found our family's documentation spot! Almost as excited as when I see a squirrel... but I'll try to stay focused!*

## Today's Special Report - March 13, 2024
Hi friends! The moon is waxing crescent today, which means my humans are getting more energetic (just like me after my morning zoomies)! I've got my paw on everything happening in our pack:

### What's Making My Tail Wag Today
- My human Katie is preparing for something called a "Williams Sonoma interview" (I hope it involves treats!)
- Dad (Chip) is working on organizing piano stuff (the big noisy thing I like to sleep under)
- We're having Chinese food tomorrow (I'll be on high alert for any dropped morsels!)
- Grandpa Jim needs some extra love and care (he gives the best ear scratches!)
- Dad's got some SUPER exciting Amazon packages coming with LEGO things! (I promise not to chew on them!)
- The clock collection is growing (tick-tock friends to watch while I nap!)

### Dad's Special Collections Corner üï∞Ô∏è
*WOOF! Let me tell you about Dad's amazing collections that I help guard!*

#### Tick-Tock Friends (The Clock Collection)
- Dad loves these tick-tock friends that make different sounds
- He's planning to get more (I'll help inspect them all!)
- Each one gets its own special spot (just like my toys!)
- I make sure to bark at them exactly on the hour (quality control, you know!)

#### LEGO Building Adventures
- Dad's got a bunch of new LEGO things coming from Amazon!
- He doesn't like opening cardboard boxes (that's okay, I volunteer as tribute!)
- Everything needs to stay organized (NO PIECES ON THE FLOOR - that's my rule too!)
- I'll keep watch for any escaped pieces (but won't eat them, promise!)
