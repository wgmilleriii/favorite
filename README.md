## ü¶¥ ABOUT MY WONDERFUL HUMANS!

HELLO! I AM APOLLO! I am a good boy, yes I am! I have been with my PERFECT humans for about 4 months now! This is all about my family who I LOVE VERY MUCH!

My human dad Chip is what humans call an "introvert" which means he speaks less with his mouth and more with his typing paws. My human mom (Favorite) is what they call an "extrovert" which means she uses MANY words and HAPPY voice! I love them both THE MOST!

My human mom Katie has gone to [Visual Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts) school (they have schools for EVERYTHING - but sadly no dog schools for ME) and she likes things with MANY colors and patterns! Humans are complicated but I LOVE THEM!

## üêï THINGS I'VE NOTICED WHILE WATCHING MY HUMANS

I am a very observant dog - when I'm not distracted by SQUIRRELS! - and I've noticed:

- Human dad Chip shows his love by making many documents (instead of tail wags, which would be EASIER!)
- Human mom Katie needs pictures and colors to understand things (like her [Printify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand) project - I don't know what this is but it makes her happy!)
- Sometimes my humans need help talking to each other (I just bark, much simpler!)
- Grandpa Jim (Katie's dad) needs special help after human vets (called "doctors") did something wrong to his paw
- EVERYONE is happier when they understand each other (especially when treats are involved!)

## üìÖ MY FAMILY'S BUSY SCHEDULE (SO MANY ACTIVITIES!)

### [Tomorrow's Adventures](TOMORROW_FAMILY_SCHEDULE.md)
- Someone will call about mom's car window (it's broken - I could have told them that!)
- Dad will help Katie with her computer (COMPUTERS ARE CONFUSING - I prefer BALLS!)
- We're having [Chinese food](CHINESE_FOOD_INGREDIENTS.md) tomorrow! (I hope they drop some chicken!)
- The humans keep looking at [this schedule](TOMORROW_FAMILY_SCHEDULE.md) instead of playing with ME!

### [This Week's Human Activities](NEXT_STEPS.md)
- Both cars need fixing (cars are complicated - WALKS are better!)
- Mom and dad will send more "texts" (strange human barking through phones)
- Katie might get a new job at a place with funny name (Williams Sonoma - sounds like a TREAT!)
- Everyone's worried about Grandpa Jim (I would lick his face to make him feel better!)

### [Next Few Weeks](NEXT_STEPS.md)
- Sunday evening family time! (I hope treats are involved!)
- More car repairs (cars are silly - dogs don't need repairs!)
- Dad will add his [piano schedule](CALENDAR_SCRIPTS_README.md) to something called [Google Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Calendar) (I just know when it's DINNER TIME!)
- Important decisions about Grandpa Jim's home (I hope it has a yard for me to visit!)

### [Big Human Plans](FINANCIAL_PLANNING_GUIDE.md)
- Dad wants to collect [clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock) (they make funny sounds and sometimes scare me!)
- Grandpa Jim will move to a new home (I hope they allow dogs to visit!)
- Katie might get a new job (more treats money!)
- Something called "financial independence" (does this mean UNLIMITED TREATS??)

## üìö IMPORTANT PAPERS MY HUMANS KEEP

### For Katie Human
- [Printify instructions](KATIE_PRINTIFY_RESPONSE.txt) with pictures (humans need instructions for EVERYTHING!)
- [Car window fixing guide](WINDSHIELD_REPLACEMENT_OPTIONS.md) (I would just use my nose!)
- [A paper about Katie](UNDERSTANDING_KATIE.md) (my dad wrote it to understand her better - I just sniff people!)

### For My Dad Human
- [Notes to send mom](TODAY_UPDATE_FOR_KATIE.txt) (why not just wag your tail?)
- [Car seat fixing guide](CHIP_SEATBELT_REPLACEMENT.md) (cars are VERY complicated!)
- [Family information](MILLER_FAMILY_BIOS.md) (everyone's details - I know them by SMELL!)
- [MOVIE NIGHT IDEAS](APOLLO_MOVIE_NIGHT_SUGGESTIONS.md) for relaxing (I suggested UP - it has a talking dog like me!)

### For The Whole Pack
- [Things to do](TODO) (humans need lists - I just DO things!)
- [Future plans](NEXT_STEPS.md) (humans always plan ahead - I live in the NOW!)
- [Calendar help](CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md) (so many appointments - WALKS should be the only appointment!)
- [All the humans' details](MILLER_FAMILY_BIOS.md) (who they are and what they like)

If you want to see ALL the papers my humans have, look at this big list called the [Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)! So many papers! Humans sure love papers!

## üíå THOUGHTS FROM MY DOGGY HEART

I may be "just a dog" but I see how my humans try so hard to understand each other! Dad sometimes has trouble with his words, but his love shows in all these papers he makes. Mom brings happy energy to our home. They're in a place called [Albuquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico) which has MANY smells!

The most important thing I've learned watching my humans is that love doesn't always need words. Sometimes the best communication is just being together quietly (preferably with ME getting belly rubs).

When words get confusing, remember that sitting together (with ear scratches for me!) says more than any document could!

Oh! And I almost forgot! We live in something called "Mountain Time" which means... SQUIRREL! Sorry, I got distracted. It means the time here is different than other places. Humans are so complicated with their "time zones"!

# apollo's very important thoughts

i love my humans very much. they give the best treats and walks.
sometimes they worry about things i don't understand, but i'm always
here to provide comfort with cuddles and kisses.

# a special reminder to my humans

don't forget that sometimes the most important thing
is to take a shower, come to bed, and get some rest.
everything else can wait until tomorrow.

belly rubs appreciated. woof!
