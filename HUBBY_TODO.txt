# HUBBY TODO LIST âœ“

Personal note: She last said "I'm fine!" YAY!

## COMMUNICATION NOTE
Katie took 45 minutes to acknowledge understanding her Printify assignment. May need extra time/patience for follow-ups. Consider:
- Using shorter, more direct instructions in future communications
- Breaking complex tasks into smaller chunks with confirmation checkpoints
- Following up with brief phone calls for time-sensitive matters

## URGENT - Katie's Printify Access
- [x] Create Printify instructions for Katie (COMPLETED - see PRINTIFY_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_KATIE.md)

- [x] Create detailed t-shirt design guide (COMPLETED - see KATIE_TSHIRT_GUIDE.md)
- [x] Prepare email response templates for confusion (COMPLETED - see KATIE_EMAIL_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md)
- [ ] Verify Katie truly understands the task (given 45-min response time, additional confirmation may be needed)
- [ ] Ensure Katie can access this specific URL: https://printify.com/app/store/products/1?itemsPerPage=24
- [ ] Verify Katie can log in successfully (test credentials together if needed)
- [ ] Walk Katie through creating her first t-shirt (via screen share if possible)
- [ ] Follow up with Katie after her first attempt to troubleshoot any issues

## ANTICIPATED: Katie's Confusion Response
- [ ] Expect delayed responses - allocate buffer time in schedule
- [ ] Watch for email from Katie with confusion about the process
- [ ] Respond quickly using pre-prepared templates in KATIE_EMAIL_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Offer a 15-minute screen sharing session if the email response isn't sufficient
- [ ] Consider recording a brief walkthrough video - may be more effective than written instructions
- [ ] Send a follow-up email 24 hours after your response to check progress
- [ ] Schedule a specific time for check-in rather than waiting for her to initiate

## Specific Steps to Ensure Katie's Access Works
1. Confirm Katie has created her Printify account
2. Send Katie the store identifier or direct connection link
3. Ask for explicit confirmation after each step is completed
4. Verify she received the correct access level (should be Admin or Manager)
5. Test that she can access the products page: https://printify.com/app/store/products/1?itemsPerPage=24
6. Schedule a 15-minute call to walk through t-shirt creation together
7. Check back after 24 hours to ensure everything is working properly

## Other Tasks (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Create HTML email update for Katie
- [ ] Update everything in Favorite's project
- [ ] Make README prettier with more specific memories
- [ ] Update documentation with our favorite moments

Remember: Favorite appreciates when you complete these tasks promptly! ðŸ˜Š

## Notes for Next Steps
* If Katie has any issues with the Printify dashboard, check browser compatibility
* Consider recording a quick video walkthrough as backup
* Keep login credentials in a secure shared location
* Be patient - most people need 2-3 attempts before they're comfortable with Printify
* For Katie specifically: factor in significantly longer response/processing times than average
* Phone calls might be more effective than emails for complex explanations
