Hi Katie,

Hope you're having a good day! Could you please send me an update on the GitHub project when you get a chance?

Specifically, I'd love to know:
→ What changes you've made recently
→ Any issues you're running into
→ What you're planning to work on next

A screenshot of your progress would be super helpful if you can share one!

No rush - whenever you have a few minutes is fine. This will help me stay in the loop and see if there's anywhere I can help.

Thanks!
Chip
