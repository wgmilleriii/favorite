[END PROMPT TEMPLATE]

[LESSONS LEARNED - March 13, 2024, Time Management Edition]
Event: Printer Research Optimization
Status: Time Recovery Protocol

WHAT HAPPENED:
- Started with printer research
- Got caught in detailed comparison loop
- Realized we just needed a good prompt template
- Pivoted to creating reusable prompt structure

TIME IMPACT ANALYSIS:
‚ùå Time Lost:
   - Detailed printer comparisons (unnecessary at this stage)
   - Multiple feature questions
   - Premature specification diving

‚úÖ Time Saved:
   - Created reusable prompt template
   - Established clear structure for future research
   - Avoided rabbit hole of premature details

KEY LESSON:
Sometimes we don't need the answer right now;
we need a better way to ask the question later.

FUTURE PROTOCOL:
1. Start with: "Do we need the answer or the method?"
2. Check if we need:
   ‚ñ° Immediate solution
   ‚ñ° Research template
   ‚ñ° Process improvement

*Note: Apollo reminds us that sometimes the best fetch strategy is planning the route first! üêæ*
