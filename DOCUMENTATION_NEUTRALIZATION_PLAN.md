# Documentation Tone Standardization Plan

## Guidelines for Documentation Files
- All standard documentation files should use a neutral, professional tone
- Documentation should prioritize clarity and comprehensive details
- README.md should maintain Apollo's unique dog perspective
- Files should follow consistent formatting standards

## Files Requiring Tone Adjustment

### Primary Documentation
1. **NEXT_60_MINUTES.md** - Convert from Katie's perspective to neutral timeline
2. **TOMORROW_FAMILY_SCHEDULE.md** - Convert from Katie's perspective to neutral schedule format
3. **GOOGLE_CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md** - Convert from Katie's perspective to neutral technical guide
4. **TODO** - Convert to standard neutral task management format

### Secondary/Creative Files
1. **MULTISPERSPECTIVE_PIZZA_NARRATIVES.md** - This can remain as a creative exercise file, but should be clearly labeled as non-standard documentation

## Implementation Priority
1. Convert primary task management documents first (TODO, schedules)
2. Update technical guides next (Calendar integration)
3. Ensure README maintains Apollo's perspective
4. Label any creative/perspective documents as supplementary materials

## Formatting Standards
- Use consistent headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Include clear section separators
- Maintain detailed lists where appropriate
- Add timestamps for version control
- Use task checkboxes consistently for action items

## Notes
- While converting to neutral tone, retain all important information and details
- Avoid loss of critical data during tone conversion
- Maintain visual organization elements that aid comprehension, even while removing personalized language

This plan will ensure all documentation meets the standard of being neutral and information-rich, while preserving the unique README perspective as specified.
