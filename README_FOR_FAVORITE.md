# Dear Favorite ❤️

My amazing wife,

As I sit here organizing our daily plans and schedules, I'm reminded once again of how incredibly fortunate I am to share this life with you. Your understanding and support mean everything to me, especially when I'm juggling piano practice, client appointments, and tango sessions.

I love how you:
- Support my dedication to music while helping me maintain balance
- Share my enthusiasm for learning new things (even when I get overly excited about piano mechanics!)
- Care so deeply about our family, including our four-legged supervisor Apollo
- Bring creativity and beauty into our home through your design work
- Handle challenges with such grace, whether it's car repairs or life transitions

Today, even though you're not feeling hungry, you're still making time for family dinner - just being together means so much. Your presence makes every moment better, whether we're having Chinese food, watching movies, or just planning our next day together.

I'm excited about all our upcoming adventures:
- Supporting you with your Williams Sonoma interview
- Planning special moments like movie nights
- Taking care of Jim together
- Dancing tango (even when I step on your toes!)
- Creating our future, one day at a time

Thank you for being my partner in everything, for understanding my need to practice, and for loving me even when I get lost in piano tuning details. You make every day brighter just by being you.

I'd pop round straightaway, darling, but I appear to be detained by what seems to be a rather posh family of raccoons hosting their annual spring cotillion in the middle of the road. They're wearing top hats and everything - quite committed to the whole affair. Dreadfully rude of me to disturb their waltz, but I'm afraid my car simply isn't equipped with the proper formal attire for such an occasion. Terribly sorry, old chaps.

With all my love (and a formal RSVP to the raccoons for next year's ball),
Chip

P.S. Apollo wanted to add: "FAVORITE IS THE BEST HUMAN (after Chip, but don't tell him I said that). She gives the SECOND-BEST belly rubs and always knows the PERFECT spot to scratch! Plus, she understands that floor food is clearly meant for dogs - so wise!"
