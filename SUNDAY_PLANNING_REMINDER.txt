Hi My love,

Just a friendly reminder about our weekly planning session tonight at 7pm!

Things to bring:
→ Your calendar (phone or planner)
→ Any questions about upcoming appointments
→ Updates on Jim's situation and Printify progress
→ Thoughts on Apollo's schedule for walks this week

I'll have:
→ Notes on car repair appointments
→ Clock collection research updates
→ Meal plan ideas for the week
→ Calendar updated with my piano tuning clients

We'll keep it to 30 minutes and then can relax for the rest of the evening.

Looking forward to getting organized for the week!
