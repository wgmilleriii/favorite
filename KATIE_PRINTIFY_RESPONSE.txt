Hi My love,

Great job clicking the link and trying to get started! You don't need to download anything special - Printify works right in your web browser.

But first, we need to make sure you have a Printify account:

1. Did you create an account yet? If not, click the "Sign Up" button first
2. After you sign up and log in, I need to connect you to our store
3. Once connected, the link will show you our products page

Let me know where you're stuck:
â€¢ Did you create an account?
â€¢ Are you logged in but seeing a blank page?
â€¢ Or something else?

The simplest solution might be a quick 5-minute phone call where I can walk you through it - I'm free anytime this evening!

We've made great progress - you've already found the right link, which is the hardest part. ðŸ˜Š
