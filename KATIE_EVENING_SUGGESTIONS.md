# ðŸŽµ Evening Music & Relaxation Suggestions
*Katie's thoughts while eating pizza*

## Records to Consider Tonight

Hey Chip! Since you're picking a record after your bathroom break, here are some ideas based on the kind of evening we could have:

### Relaxing Options
- **Bill Evans Trio** - Perfect background for reviewing our calendar together
- **Norah Jones** - If you want something soothing but with vocals
- **Bach's Cello Suites** - For when you want to clear your mind completely

### Upbeat Choices
- **Stevie Wonder** - In case you want something positive while we plan tomorrow
- **The Beatles** - Always a mood lifter when we're being productive
- **Fleetwood Mac** - Good balance of energy and mellowness

I noticed you seem a bit tired, so maybe something not too intense would be good? The Bill Evans might be perfect for our calendar planning session at 7:00.

## After-Music Activities

When you're done picking the record, maybe we could:

1. Review the schedule I made for tomorrow (I used my visual organization system!)
2. Go through the color-coding system I suggested for our calendars
3. Talk about those retirement home options for Dad while we finish the pizza
4. Relax with that movie Apollo suggested

## Visual Setup for Planning

If we're going to look at calendars later, I'd appreciate if we could:
- Use the physical whiteboard in the kitchen 
- Have colored markers for my color-coding system
- Put our laptops side by side so I can see everything at once

I find it so much easier to process information when it's laid out visually like that.

## Our Evening Timeline

- Now: Finish pizza, select record
