> **Apollo says:** A WHOLE HOUR is SO LONG in dog time! I could run around the yard 527 times, bark at 43 squirrels, take another nap, and STILL wonder why humans take so long in the shower! The BEST part is when dad makes food - sometimes things fall on the floor and guess who gets them? ME! I'M THE FLOOR CLEANER!
