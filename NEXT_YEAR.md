> **Apollo says:** A WHOLE YEAR of planning?! By then I'll be an EVEN OLDER and WISER dog! I'm especially excited about my ADOPTION ANNIVERSARY because that sounds like it might involve SPECIAL TREATS and maybe even a NEW TOY! I'm also interested in this "Denver trip" - I hope I get to go too! New places mean NEW SMELLS and possibly SNOW to play in!
