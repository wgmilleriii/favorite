# Anticipated Email Responses for Katie's Printify Questions

## Common Points of Confusion and Ready Responses

### "I can't log in to Printify"

Hi Katie,

Sorry you're having trouble logging in! Let's troubleshoot:

1. Double-check you're using the email address you registered with
2. Try the "Forgot Password" option to reset your credentials
3. Make sure you're going to https://printify.com/app/login directly
4. Try using Chrome or Firefox if you're using a different browser
5. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again

Let me know if these steps help. If not, I can schedule a quick call to get you set up.

### "I don't see our store after logging in"

Hi Katie,

If you're logged in but don't see our store, we need to complete the connection:

1. I'll send you a fresh store invitation link (check your email in 5 minutes)
2. When you receive it, click the link while logged into your Printify account
3. This should automatically connect you to our store
4. If that doesn't work, please send me a screenshot of what you're seeing

### "The specific product URL isn't working"

Hi Katie,

That link might require you to be fully connected to our store first. Try these steps:

1. Go to the main Printify dashboard
2. Click on "Products" in the left sidebar
3. You should see our existing products or an option to add new ones
4. Let me know if you can access this area

If you're still having issues, I can share my screen for a quick walkthrough - just let me know what time works for you.

### "I don't know what design to upload"

Hi Katie,

For your first design, I'd recommend:

1. Start with the simple logo I've attached to this email
2. It's already sized correctly and has a transparent background
3. Try placing it on a Gildan 64000 t-shirt in Navy Blue
4. This will give you practice with the basic workflow

We can tackle more complex designs after you're comfortable with the process.

### "I'm confused about pricing/publishing"

Hi Katie,

For your first test t-shirt:

1. Set the retail price at $24.99 (our standard pricing)
2. Include S-XL sizes only
3. Select just 2-3 color options to keep it simple
4. For publishing, select "Save as Draft" rather than publishing directly
5. This lets me review before it goes live

### "The design editor is confusing me"

Hi Katie,

The design editor can be tricky at first! Let's simplify:

1. For your first attempt, just focus on front placement
2. Use the "Center" button to align your design
3. Size it so it's roughly 10" wide on the preview
4. Stick with the default mockup view for now

Would a 15-minute screen sharing session help? I'm available tomorrow between 2-4pm if that works for you.

## General Positive Response Template

Hi Katie,

Thanks for your email! I completely understand your confusion - Printify has a learning curve for everyone at first.

[Insert specific response to her question from above]

Remember, this is just a learning process, and it's completely normal to have questions. I've gone through all these same hurdles myself! 

Let me know if this helps, or if you'd prefer, we can set up a quick call to walk through it together.

Talk soon,
